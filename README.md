## What you ned to know to contribute

We use Git to collaborate on all our projects. We value heatlhy relationships between our teams as well as clean and maintanable code. Hence, we can't stress enough how much respecting best practices is important. We use the [Angular Commit Messsage Covention](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c) and our contributions always pass through [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) reviews.
